# 2D Triangle
The simplest test to see if your renderer even outputs anything.

## Input
The triangle is already in NDC space, so even if space transformations aren't implemented in your renderer, test should still pass.

Triangle coordinates:
```
Vertex 1: [0.0, 0.5]
Vertex 2: [-0.5, -0.5]
Vertex 3: [0.5, -0.5]
Face indices: 1 2 3
```

## Expected output
### Wireframe
### Flat shading
### Gourard shading
