# Renderer Basic Tests

This repository contains a suite of progressively advanced tests designed to validate the functionality of different renderers. These tests serve as benchmarks for ensuring consistent and correct behavior across various graphics APIs, including **OpenGL**, **DirectX**, **Vulkan** and **software renderers**.

## Introduction

The tests start from the basics, such as rendering a single flat triangle, and progress to advanced features like physically based rendering (PBR) and shadow mapping. These tests can help you in progressively achieving accuracy and feature completeness in your renderer.

Each test includes:
- **Description**: The purpose of the test.
- **Input Data**: Geometry, textures, and other relevant inputs.
- **Expected Output**: Images or descriptions of correct results.

## Test List
- **01: Flat Triangle**
- **02: Interpolated Triangle**
- **03: Wireframe Cube**
